# Sign up page

A signup/landing page created from scratch apart from regex strings for name and email address.


### Process
- Wrote out base of HTML page and form
- Converted rocketship and cloud image to SVG using Adobe Illustrator
- Wrote out stylesheet
- Wrote out JS to make sure the form removes all words when user clicks in
- Created rocketship progress animation
- Wrote out JS to make sure that validation error messages occur when the string doesn't match a name or an email in an email@address.com format
- Wrote out JS so that the button isn't clickable until user fills it out properly

Created for the purposes of more winter break javascript and web dev afternoon practice... Wrote this without jQuery so that it had the chance to load faster and so I could have more pure JS practice.
